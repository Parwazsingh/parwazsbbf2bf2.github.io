          <p>
            As a Master of Science in Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University, I bring a robust skill set in programming languages including C++, Python, and Java. My technical expertise extends to web technologies such as HTML, CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS, and I am proficient in databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase. I hold certifications from prestigious platforms like Udemy and Coursera, enhancing my knowledge in web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            My practical experience is underscored by internships at Nahar Group of Companies and Metaphor Networks in India, where I honed my full-stack development skills. These roles allowed me to work on various APIs, improve user interfaces, and participate in comprehensive software development cycles. Additionally, my academic projects showcase my capabilities in machine learning and data analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about harnessing technology to create innovative and impactful solutions for diverse domains and audiences. I am a leader and a collaborator in tech organizations, where I teach, mentor, and advise peers and juniors on web development and other topics. I am always eager to learn, grow, and connect with others who share my vision and values. I am actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2024, where I can contribute to cutting-edge projects and initiatives in the dynamic world of technology.

              <p class="project-category">
                In the Flight Fare Prediction project, advanced machine learning techniques were employed to analyze and predict airfare prices. The project involved extensive data preprocessing and feature selection on a comprehensive dataset of flight prices. A variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, were utilized to forecast flight fares. Notably, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy, proving to be a valuable tool in helping customers make cost-effective booking decisions.

              <p class="project-category">
                In the Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction project, we developed a machine learning model for “ABC BANK” to predict customer churn rates effectively. This model analyzes various factors like credit scores, geographical locations, account balances, and customer activity to identify the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services. Utilizing a dataset with key variables such as customer demographics, account details, and transaction history, the model was trained on a 70/30 split of training and test sets. Feature engineering played a crucial role in refining the data for accuracy. The project emphasized evaluating the model’s performance on both sets to ensure reliability and address any overfitting issues, aiming to provide the bank with a predictive tool to mitigate customer attrition and uphold its reputation.

                  <p class="blog-text">
                    New clients cost a business significantly more money in e-commerce than keeping its existing clients. Companies can boost consumer retention, which will result in more revenue and faster growth, by anticipating which customers will quit. There are several products and solutions in today’s competitive industry. Because of this, most clients are accustomed to quickly switching from one brand to another and from one supplier to another in their search for the best possible product or item to fulfill their requirements. This problem, known as “client churn,” affects e-commerce enterprises. Due to their ability to process large volumes of data and recognize complex patterns, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting client churn in recent years. Using a publicly accessible dataset, the proposed model examines various machine learning methods for predicting customer churn in this study. Also, by using performance metrics, the proposed model compares how well different algorithms perform.

                  <p class="blog-text">
                    As more and more people look for ways to get from one place to another more quickly, air travel has developed into an indispensable component of the modern way of life. The prices of airline tickets are subject to sporadic increases or decreases, based on a variety of criteria such as the scheduling of the flights, the destination, and the duration of the flights, as well as numerous events and occasions such as holidays and celebrations. As a result, having at least a general concept of the costs of the flights before beginning to organize the trip will undoubtedly assist a great number of people in saving both money and time. The accumulated flight history will be used in our system to inform the development of a prediction model, which will be accomplished by employing machine learning methods. People will get an understanding from this system about the trends that prices follow, and it will also provide a forecast price value that they can refer to before purchasing flight tickets in order to save money. Customers may receive this kind of system or service if it is made available to them.
